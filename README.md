# Semantic Kernel demo repository
This repository contains multiple demos about Semantic Kernel, including:
- [sam-report-generator](https://github.com/whiteducksoftware/demo-ai-semantic-kernel/tree/main/src/sam-report-generator): An agent that creates a report based on notes. Uses the planner (HandlebarsPlanner) as well as native and semantic plugins.
- [wd-mainboardgpt](https://github.com/whiteducksoftware/demo-ai-semantic-kernel/tree/main/src/wd-mainboardgpt): The goal of this project is to develop a proof of concept for an agent that assists users with finding relevant information in a library of technical documentation. It uses the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pattern to include these information for the LLM.
- [rag-ai-search](https://github.com/whiteducksoftware/demo-ai-semantic-kernel/tree/main/src/rag-ai-search): RAG-Copilot implementation, which allows questions to be asked on the basis of documents provided.
